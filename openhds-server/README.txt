Architecture
--------------------

OpenHDS architecture is documented here:

A brief description of sub-components follows.

### Core components

controller:
    Handles authentication, ID generation, services for updating the DB and
    a few utilities.
    Generation of external IDs can be custimized to improve human-readability.
domain:
    A representation of the underlying data model (that used in the database).

    domain model to the database.

    Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) controllers for the web forms.

Also mentioned on the above wiki page is `Service`.
