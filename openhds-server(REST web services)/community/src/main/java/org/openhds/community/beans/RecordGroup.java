 * This is used in the DHIS export for subdividing an interval based on the type it is.
 * A RecordGroup consists of a name, which represents the particular group it's for.
 * For example, Death, Pregnancy Outcome, and Population are valid RecordGroup names. 
 * Start and End times represent the time this group is being considered. It contains a 
 * reference to a RecordBean which is helpful for breaking down a particular RecordGroup 
 * into which region in the hierarchy they belong. Do not use this class directly, just
 * supply the proper parameters to the Period and this structure will be constructed 
 * automatically.
